Hi 👋, I'm Ansaf! I am a CSE student. I'm on an exciting path to become a full-stack web dev. A major turning point was when i found out [tanaypratap.com](https://www.tanaypratap.com). I love to get to know people from all around the world, but, still an introvert, so If you happen to find me, please approach me😄😅.<br><br><br>


## My values
🍏 Putting in work will definitely pay-off<br>
🙌 Knowledge is treasure. Should be only found by those who come looking for it. Not like youtube recommendation.<br><br><br>


## 🔭 Goals of 2021
Just discovered about the web dev world. Need to find out more and complete frontend web dev part this year. <br><br><br>


## 📚 Langues that I know
- HTML5
- CSS
- PYTHON

### 🙄 Honestly
Just getting started with github. I'm really looking forward to learn and update more frequently.  <br><br><br>
